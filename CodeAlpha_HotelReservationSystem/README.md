Hotel Reservation System (CodeAlpha Internship Project)

📌 Overview
The Hotel Reservation System is a Java-based application designed to manage hotel bookings efficiently.  
It allows users to view available rooms, book a room, check reservation details, and handle customer records.  
This project demonstrates practical knowledge of Java OOP, data handling, GUI design, and real-world application development.

⚙️ How the System Works
1. Rooms are loaded into the system with:
   - Room Number  
   - Room Type  
   - Price  
   - Availability  
2. User selects an action:
   - Check available rooms  
   - Book a room  
   - View reservations  
   - Cancel reservation  
3. During booking:
   - User enters name, room type, and contact information  
   - System checks availability  
   - Assigns a room and stores reservation data  
4. All reservation details are stored and displayed on request.
